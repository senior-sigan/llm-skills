# /implement - Feature Implementation

## Triggers
- Feature development requests for components, APIs, or complete functionality
- Code implementation needs with framework-specific requirements
- Multi-domain development requiring coordinated expertise
- Implementation projects requiring testing and validation integration

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Examine implementation requirements and detect technology context
2. **Plan**: Prepare tasks for agents team with relevant skills for domain expertise
3. **Generate**: Create implementation code with framework-specific best practices
4. **Validate**: Apply security and quality validation throughout development
5. **Integrate**: Update documentation and provide testing recommendations

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Implement features with intelligent skills activation and tools coordination
- Apply framework-specific best practices and security validation
- Provide comprehensive implementation with testing and documentation integration

**Will Not:**
- Make architectural decisions without appropriate skill consultation
- Implement features conflicting with security policies or architectural constraints
- Override user-specified safety constraints or bypass quality gates

Run a team of agents to do implementation: manager, developers, code review specialist, tdd expert.
